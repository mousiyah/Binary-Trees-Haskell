# Binary-Trees-Haskell
There are several examples of tree programs you can learn from. Read descriptions of them below<br><br>
<b>isBalanced.hs</b><br>
Define a function that decides whether a tree is balanced.<br>
We call a tree balanced if the differences of the heights of left subtree and right subtree at each node differ at most by 1.<br>
Is the tree that you have given as an example balanced?<br><br>
<b>flattenTree.hs</b><br>
A tree is called search tree if it flattens to a list that is ordered.<br>
Give two examples of trees such that one of them is a search tree but the other isnâ€™t. Compute the flattenings of both trees.<br>
Write a function insert such that if n is an integer and t is a search tree then insert n t is again a search tree that contains the nodes of t and in addition the integer n. If n occurs already in t, then insert n t should be equal to t.
